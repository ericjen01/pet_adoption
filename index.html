            <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
            <p>The Pet Rescue exits to provide care, training and companionship to our furry fellows, and strive to find them place they can call home.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Since 2022, The Pet Rescue has been working to find homes and provide cares of the rescued companion animals. 
            Run by a volunteer group of veterinary care staffs the purpose of our work at The Pet Rescue can be divided into two streams:</p>
                
            <h1>RESCUE AND CARE</h1>
            <p>As a volunteer-based animal well-being organization we strive to protect and improve the quality of life of companion animals. 
            We care for any animal including a pet surrendered by their owners, a stray animal that has been abandoned as well as any animal that has suffered neglect from proper treatments.
            Our well-trained staffs work daily to to help abandoned/stray animals, address overpopulation, provide health care to animals in need due to illness and neglect.
                
            <h1>PET ADOPTION</h1>
            <p>The Pet Rescue provides medical care and accommodation for our animals as we strive to find them new loving homes.
                We intake approximately 150 animals per year from the municipalities and respond to all potential families or individuals with a strong dedication to adopt a fellow friend. 
                The Pet Rescue's low-cost adoption procedure and clinical services provides quality pet care at an affordable cost. 
                For additional information regarding adopting a pet, feel free to <a>*********get in touch with our team of volunteers******</a> </p>

                <h1>WHY ADOPT A PET OVER BUYING?</h1>
                <P>The pet population in Canada is growing fast because of the country's aging population. The trend of pet adoption is on the rise with the society's increasing understanding to the benefits of helping our furry companions.
                    The Pet Rescue offers an adoption program ensuring a safe, reliable and free way to find a loving home for each fellow.</P>
                <p>Thinking of adding a pet to your family? Here are the reasons to consider adopting a pet from an animal shelter or rescue:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>New home, new hope- You will be giving pets a warm shelter they have longed for</li>
                    <li>You'll save a life- Owned pets generally live longer, healthier lives than strays</li>
                    <li>Low costs- The average cost for adopting an animal is much less than purchasing one</li>s
                    <li>Making a contribution- Caring for a pet can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Also you can feel proud about helping an animal in need!</li>
                </ul>
